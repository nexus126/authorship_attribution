## Project Overview
Author attribution "is the task of identifying the author of a given text from a (given) set of suspects".

In this paper we propose a dataset unpublished in the AA task. 
The domain of the dataset seems to be novel also for to the pre-trained language models we propose in the various [notebooks](https://github.com/LeonardRanaldi/AuthorshipAttribution/blob/main/Holistic_Transformers.ipynb).
Next to pre-trained language models we test [symbolic-lexical models](), [style-based models](https://github.com/LeonardRanaldi/AuthorshipAttribution/blob/main/BoW.ipynb), and [syntax-based models](https://github.com/LeonardRanaldi/AuthorshipAttribution/blob/main/BoPOS.ipynb). 

## File Descriptions
The proposed dataset can be found at the following [link](https://www.azsecure-data.org/dark-web-forums.html).

_"An English-language forum dedicated to various topics of interest to Muslims, ranging from theology to discussions of recent world events. Some registered members sympathize with and support terrorist organizations."_
